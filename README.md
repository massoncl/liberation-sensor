This is a custom component for Home Assistant. 
The French newspaper Lib√©ration has a [live feed](http://www.liberation.fr/direct) where they regularly post short summaries of current events.
This sensor parses that feed, finds the latest summary and converts it into markdown to be shown in a Markdown card.


This sensor is activated by adding the following into your `configuration.yaml` :

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: liberation_sensor
    unique_id: "liberation_recap"
    scan_interval: 900
```
